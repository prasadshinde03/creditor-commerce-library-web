## Functional overview
### Introduction
The Creditor Commerce Library is a web library that enables a Creditor to enable payments through a consumer selected debtor participant on a single device.

Library APIs/Functions enable the Creditor to get information about the DSPs Participant banks which enabled for PBA-RFP. This information can be used by the Creditor to display supported banks on their website during an invoice presentment. A consumer can see the available banks then select and launch a specific one which they want to pay with.

### Journey Use Cases

**1. Pay Only Use Case (Single Immediate Payment) -** <br />
Pay only journey allows Consumers to use Pay by Account (PbA) Request for Payment method. A sample Pay only Consumer journey includes the following steps:
 - Consumer on Creditor website presented with debtor’s list after checkout steps.
 - On selection of preferred debtor, bank app is launched with the help of Universal/App link. 
 - Consumer receives the transaction details and confirms the payment on the DSPs Participant bank App.
 - Consumer is presented the payment confirmation on the DSPs Participant bank App.
 - When the payment confirmation has been completed, Creditor website displays the success page or cancel page based on transaction status.

The following sequence diagram shows the interaction between the Creditor website and DSP Bank app:

### Creditor Commerce Library Integration Steps
#### General Requirements
If Creditor is integrating Creditor Commerce library into plain web-based HTML web application, then consider jQuery plugin to handle the html DOM manipulation work otherwise we don’t need jQuery plugin.
jQuery library version which is considered while integration:

|Component |                                    	Version                   |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JQuery   |	3.5.1                                                             |
###### Table 3: Web Creditor Commerce Library – jQuery requirements

jQuery is used by the Creditor website to perform various operations. It should be the first script to be imported in the project. jQuery can be included by printing the following HTML script tag in the parent HTML page in the header section on our project index page. This will import jQuery plugin into the project.

```javascript
	<head>
	...
    	<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
	...
    </head>
```

**Note**: This version of jQuery is the current certified version for Web Creditor API functioning on the supported browsers and devices. Support for the latest version of jQuery is on the library Product Roadmap and will be considered for future releases of it.

#### Library Integration
The file name is: **Creditor_Commerce_Library_Web.zip** (see section Certified Browsers and Devices for downloading the version compatible). Alternatively, you can also clone the project. 

Extract the **Creditor_Commerce_Library_Web.zip** and add the **artefact.js** in the project. Import the JavaScript library **artefact.js** in the parent page where the bank list needs to be displayed by adding the script tag in the html page.

**Procedure steps** 

**A)** Import the library file **artefact.js** (downloaded on the Creditors web application) in the parent page where the DSP’s needs to be displayed. 
```javascript
<html>
    <head>
    	<script src="../zapp-creditor-commerce-library-web/assets/artefact.js"></script>
    </head>
</html>
```

**B)** The Creditor Commerce library could be added into Creditor web application by adding invoking getDspDetails function with manifestCdnUrl location. Please follow sample code snapshot for the same.
	
**Note**: This will fetch DSP list. Merchant can show case the list as per their implementation.
```javascript
var dspCdnLocation = "https://mastercard-provided-cdn-file-location"; // CDN location to fetch the DSP details
$(document).ready(function() {
	/*
	* The only data that is required to be passed is manifest file url to get the onboarded DSP list and its details to show
	*    the details on merchant side.
	*/
	var invokeGetDspDetailsApi = function() {
		zappCreditorCommerceApi.getDspDetails(dspCdnLocation).then(function(result) {
			merchantFunctionToRenderDspLogoAndDetails();
		})
		.catch(function (error) {
			console.log(error);
		});
	};
	invokeGetDspDetailsApi();
});
```

**Note**: 
For integration of library into website developed using frontend framework like Angular or ReactJs then follow native steps. For Angular application V2+ add library path into angular.json file like below snapshot. 
Example:
```javascript
"architect":{
	"build":{
		"options": {
			"scripts": [
				...
				...
				"../zapp-creditor-commerce-library-web/assets/artefact.js"
			]
		}
	}
}
```

### Creditor Commerce Library API Interface
The Creditor Commerce Library API interface has the following functions and objects to be integrated by the Creditor web application.

**1. Journey Type Object**:<br />
Merchant website can use **zappCreditorCommerceJourneyTypes** object to access the journey types provided by library. Merchant can access the object via **zappCreditorCommerceApi** global instance.

```javascript
zappCreditorCommerceApi.zappCreditorCommerceJourneyTypes = {
	requestToPay:"RequestToPay",
    requestToLink:"RequestToLink"
};
```

**Note**: 
 	If Creditor/Merchant wants to initiated Payment Request Journey then request type must be passed to library is ***“requestToPay”***  
	If Creditor/Merchant wants to initiated Link Account Journey, then request type must be passed to library is ***“requestToLink”***  

**2. getDspDetails(manifestCdnUrl)**:<br />
Fetch the list of supported DSPs Participant banks by using this function. It accepts one parameter **manifestCdnUrl** (provided by MasterCard onboarding team)
The function returns the JSON array which contains following DSP details, 

 - *dspName* 
 - *dspApiVersion*
 - *dspLogoURL*
 - *dspUniqueId* 
 - *appIconHash*

**Note**: 
	Use this function for Pay only, Pay and Link, Link only journey’s and it returns the DSP list.

```
### Usages
Use the following steps to invoke the library’s API in the Creditor web application.

#### **Get DSP Details**
Use this library method to fetch the registered DSP’s participant bank and render on merchant web application. 
Function Name: 
```
zappCreditorCommerceApi.getDspDetails(manifestCdnUrl):
```

**Note**: CDN URL file path is provide by Mastercard Zapp during onboarding. Creditor/Merchant’s needs to use this path at the time of getDspDetails function call as a parameter. 
```
var manifestCdnUrl = "https://mastercard-provided-cdn-file-URL";// CDN URL to get the DSP details
$(document).ready(function() {
    var CreditorFunctionToInvokeGetDspDetailsApi = function () {
        zappCreditorCommerceApi.getDspDetails(manifestCdnUrl).then(function(result) {
    
            //Promise is resolved, use the zappCreditorCommerceApiobjects to display the bank details.
            //Two zappCreditorCommerceApiobjects are:
    
            //zappCreditorCommerceApi.getDspDetails – A list of banks with the following details.
            //dspLogo: Bank logo "https://cdn/..../bankName-bank.png"
            //dspName: The name of DSP’s participant bank
            //dspUniqueId: Unique Id created for specific Debtor.
            //dspApiVersion: DSP API versions
            //appIconHash: This is bank logo base64encoded hash value
    
            //zappCreditorCommerceApi.dspCount– Total number of banks configured
    
            //renderDspList();
            
            }).catch(function (error) {
            // Creditor specific code for exception handling
        });
    };
}
```
Sample Response: 
```
[ {
    "dspUniqueId": "partnerBankV5001",
    "dspName": "Partner Bank",
    "dspLogo": "https://www.ghobank.com/dsp-logos/partner-bank.png",
    "dspApiVersion": 4,
    "dspAppIconHash": "JtRQFjnON6ny_Gps_cBHuYiR4ZeKaEL50miNUrI8X28="
},
...
]
```
#### **Invoke Bank App**:
To invoke the universal/App link use this library method. This method uses browser native functionality to open link in a new tab when we select particular DSP. If the bank app is installed then respective bank app will launch, if not then its configured Netbanking URL will get open.

Function Name:
```
zappCreditorCommerceApi.invokeApp = function (dspId, lifecycleId, businessType, journeyType)
```
**Note**: Request parameters are provided by the merchant to the library function.
```
$(document).ready(function() {
    var MerchantFunctionToinvokeAppApi = function () {
    //- invoke app function is used to invoke a parameterised universal link for a perticular DSP selected by merchant

   //These parameters are required for invokeApp function

   /** if selected journey is requestToPay **/

   zappCreditorCommerceApi.invokeApp(dspUniqueId, paymentRequestLifecycleId, businessType, zappCreditorCommerceApi.zappCreditorCommerceJourneyTypes.requestToPay);
    
    //a. dspUniqueId - Selected bank uniqueId.
    //b. paymentRequestLifeCycleId - It will received from createPaymentAPI() response
    //c. businessType – ‘2’ for PBA-RFP product
    //d. journeyType – ‘RequestToPay’
    
   /** if selected journey is requestToLink&Pay **/
    zappCreditorCommerceApi.invokeApp(dspUniqueId, paymentRequestLifecycleId, businessType, zappCreditorCommerceApi.zappCreditorCommerceJourneyTypes.requestToPay);
    //The only difference in this journey we append "agreementType" parameter in POST data
    //when we call createPayment gateway API

    //a. dspUniqueId - Selected bank uniqueId.
    //b. paymentRequestLifeCycleId - It will received from createPaymentAPI() response
    //c. businessType – ‘2’ for PBA-RFP product
    //d. journeyType – ‘requestToLink’

    /** if selected journey is requestToLink **/
    zappCreditorCommerceApi.invokeApp(dspUniqueId, agreementLifecycleId, businessType, zappCreditorCommerceApi.zappCreditorCommerceJourneyTypes.requestToLink);
    
    //a. dspUniqueId - Selected bank uniqueId.
    //b. agreementLifecycleId - It will received from createLinkAPI() response
    //c. businessType – ‘2’ for PBA-RFP product
    //d. journeyType – ‘requestToLink’
    };
}
```
**Note**: As a response we can see the library opens up the bank app, for a selected DSP.

#### **Get Universal Link**:
Function returns the parameterised universal link for the selected DSP’s which merchant can use as per the way they want to launch bank app.
Function Name: 
```
zappCreditorCommerceApi.getUniversalLink = function (dspId, lifecycleId, businessType, journeyType);
```
**Note**: Request parameters are provided by the merchant to the library function.
```
$(document).ready(function() {
    var MerchantFunctionTogetUniversalLinkApi = function () {
		//- getUniversalLink app function is used to fetch a parameterised universal link from library method and  merchant then can use this url as per their implementation.

	   //These parameters are required for getUniversalLink function

	   /** if selected journey is requestToPay **/
		
		var parameterisedLink =

### Template file
The **externalJs.template** file contains the sample code to demonstrate the use of the Creditor Commerce Library library. This code also depicts the implementation of the custom method to post payment request to the Creditor Server. This file resides in the Creditor Commerce Library library folder along with the artefact.js file. 

**Note**: Any data elements and comments in Italic are a Creditor specific data element which must be provided by the Creditor. 

**Assumption**	This is the JavaScript file used on the Creditor’s website.


##### Sample code:

```javascript	
/** This configuration file template is used to define and override variables and functions for the creditor commerce library
 **/
/* Define the variables */
var merchantPollInterval = 5000; // Merchant poll interval of 5 seconds to poll the merchant server for link and payment notification.
var dspCdnLocation = "https://domain-name/cdn-file-location"; // CDN location to fetch the DSP details
var merchantCustomUniversalLink = null; // This variable holds the reference to the custom parameterised universal-link return to merchant rather than invoke function

/* Override the 
merchantFunctionToRenderDspLogoAndDetails() 
and 
merchantFunctionToHandleInvokeFunctionApi()
and 
merchantFunctionToHandleGetUniversalLinkFunctionApi() 
functions.

### Error Codes
The Creditor Commerce Library captures some errors. It defines a set of predefined errors which are reported to the merchant web applications.
The library returns an event which contains object with error Id, error description. Below mentioned table describes all the predefined error codes in Creditor Commerce Library.
##### Sample error object:

```javascript
zappCreditorCommerceApiError:{
“errorMessage”: "Error Description",
“errorCode”: "xxx"
}
```
###### Table 4: 	Creditor Commerce Library API library – Error Codes

Error codes|Error description|Cause of the error
-----------|-----------------|------------------
1001|DSP Id is invalid.|This error occurs when DSP unique Id or participant Id value found null or undefined or not matching with manifest file DSP’s provided unique id.|
1002|Lifecycle id is invalid.|This error occurs when secure token value provided to library from API response is found null or undefined.|
1003|Business type is invalid.|This error occurs when Business Type value provided to library found null or undefined.|
1004|Journey type is invalid.|This error occurs when Journey Type value provided to library found null or undefined or not matching with the library exposed journey type objects.|
1005|Unable to reach to configured URL. Please check and reconfigure dsp manifest file URL.|This error occurs when manifest file URL is empty.|
1006|Invalid protocol, secure protocol HTTPS is only supported.|This error occurs when manifest manifestCdnUrl is not having Secure protocol HTTPS.|
1007|Invalid dsp manifest file. Please recheck and configure again.|When wrong/invalid parameter configurations in file dsplist and due to which its invalid then in this case library checks for that and throw error.|
MC1001| Technical error occurred | If Api gets Failed, Response is not 200

### Troubleshooting
This section covers the different troubleshooting scenarios and the behaviour of the Creditor Commerce Library API. 
1. For the library to work as expected the default browser settings should allow pop ups to open on the mobile device.
2. If merchant is using jquery ajax call to invoke Submit RFP then merchant must wait for the ajax call to complete to invoke the **zappCreditorCommerceApi.invokeApp** function of the library. Alternatively merchant can use the **async: false** parameter when making an ajax call. Refer the template file in the library for an example.
3. The Creditor Commerce Library API library opens a new tab to redirect to the universal link provided by the bank. If the bank app is not installed on the consumer’s device then the page displayed on the new opened tab is handled by the bank.
